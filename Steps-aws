Certainly! Here are detailed steps to launch an EC2 instance on AWS:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Console:**
   - Open your web browser and go to the AWS Console: [https://aws.amazon.com/console/](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Sign in using your AWS account credentials.

2. **Navigate to EC2:**
   - In the AWS Console, type "EC2" in the search bar or find it under "Compute" services in the services menu.

3. **Launch an Instance:**
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, click on the "Launch Instance" button.

4. **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):**
   - You'll be presented with a list of available AMIs. Choose an AMI that suits your needs. Amazon Linux 2 is a popular choice for general purposes.

5. **Choose an Instance Type:**
   - Select the instance type that fits your requirements. The "t2.micro" instance type is available under the Free Tier.

6. **Configure Instance Details:**
   - You can leave most of the settings as default, but you may want to pay attention to options like:
     - **Number of instances:** Set it to 1 (unless you need multiple instances).
     - **Network:** Choose your preferred VPC.
     - **Subnet:** Choose a subnet within your selected VPC.
     - **Auto-assign Public IP:** Choose "Enable" if you want your instance to have a public IP.
     - **IAM Role:** If necessary, select an IAM role that you've previously set up.

**NOTE : Check the boxex that contains allow https traffic from internet and http traffic from internet.**

7. **Add Storage:**
   - By default, a root volume will be added. You can adjust the size or add additional volumes if needed.

8. **Add Tags (Optional):**
   - You can add key-value pairs as tags to help you identify and organize your resources. This step is optional but can be very helpful.

9. **Configure Security Group:**
   - Create a new security group or select an existing one. This controls the inbound and outbound traffic to your instance. At a minimum, you should allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80 and 443) if you want to access the instance via a web browser.

10. **Review and Launch:**
    - Review your instance details and configuration. Make sure everything looks correct.

11. **Launch:**
    - Click the "Launch" button.

12. **Key Pair:**
    - A pop-up will appear asking you to select or create a key pair. If you don't have one, you'll need to create a new one. Download the private key file (.pem) and keep it in a secure location.

13. **Accessing Your Instance:**
    - Once the instance is running, you can connect to it using SSH (Secure Shell) with the private key you downloaded.

Congratulations! You have successfully launched an EC2 instance on AWS. Remember to stop or terminate your instance when you're not using it to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.
