1. **Open Your Terminal (Linux or macOS) or Use a SSH Client (Windows):**

2. **Navigate to the Directory Containing Your Private Key:**

   For example, if your private key file is named `my-key.pem` and it's located in your `Downloads` directory, you would use the following command:

   ```bash
   cd Downloads
   ```

3. **Change Permissions for the Private Key File:**

   For security reasons, the private key file should not be publicly viewable. Use the following command to change the permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod 400 my-key.pem
   ```

4. **Connect to Your EC2 Instance:**

   Use the following command to connect to your instance. Replace `your-instance-public-dns` with the actual public DNS of your EC2 instance, and `my-key.pem` with the name of your private key file:

   ```bash
   ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@ec2-123-45-678-910.compute-1.amazonaws.com
   ```

   If you are using a different user or AMI (Amazon Machine Image), replace `ec2-user` with the appropriate username. For example, for an Amazon Linux AMI, you would use `ec2-user`, for an Ubuntu AMI, you would use `ubuntu`, etc.

5. **Accept the EC2 Instance Host Key (Optional):**

   The first time you connect to a new EC2 instance, you may be prompted to accept the host key. Type `yes` and press Enter.

6. **You Are Now Connected to Your EC2 Instance:**

   Once connected, you'll see a command prompt for your EC2 instance. You can now interact with your instance via the command line.

Remember to keep your private key secure and not share it with others. Also, make sure to terminate or stop your instance when you're done using it to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.
